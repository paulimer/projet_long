  abstract = {The field of spatial transcriptomics is rapidly expanding, and with it the repertoire of available technologies. However, several of the transcriptome-wide spatial assays do not operate on a single cell level, but rather produce data comprised of contributions from a – potentially heterogeneous – mixture of cells. Still, these techniques are attractive to use when examining complex tissue specimens with diverse cell populations, where complete expression profiles are required to properly capture their richness. Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. To illustrate the capacity of our method, we use data from different experimental platforms and spatially map cell types from the mouse brain and developmental heart, which arrange as expected.},

  abstract = {Charting an organs’ biological atlas requires us to spatially resolve the entire single-cell transcriptome, and to relate such cellular features to the anatomical scale. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can profile cells comprehensively, but lose spatial information. Spatial transcriptomics allows for spatial measurements, but at lower resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput. To overcome these limitations we present Tangram, a method that aligns sc/snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same region, including MERFISH, STARmap, smFISH, Spatial Transcriptomics (Visium) and histological images. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multimodal data such as those from SHARE-seq, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate Tangram on healthy mouse brain tissue, by reconstructing a genome-wide anatomically integrated spatial map at single-cell resolution of the visual and somatomotor areas.},

Here, we develop robust cell type decomposition (RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA-seq to decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences across sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of RCTD to detect mixtures and identify cell types on simulated datasets. Furthermore, RCTD accurately reproduces known cell type and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium datasets of the mouse brain. Finally, we show how RCTD’s recovery of cell type localization enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD enables the spatial components of cellular identity to be defined, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue. RCTD is publicly available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/dmcable/RCTD.},

In biology, single-cell genomics studies typically begin with reduction to two or three dimensions to produce ‘all-in-one’ visuals of the data that are amenable to the human eye, and these are subsequently used for qualitative and quantitative exploratory analysis. However, there is little theoretical support for this practice, and we show that extreme dimension reduction, from hundreds or thousands of dimensions to two, inevitably induces significant distortion of high-dimensional datasets. We therefore examine the practical implications of low-dimensional embedding of single-cell data, and find that extensive distortions and inconsistent practices make such embeddings counter-productive for exploratory, biological analyses. In lieu of this, we discuss alternative approaches for conducting targeted embedding and feature exploration, to enable hypothesis-driven biological discovery.},

  abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow researchers to examine transcriptional profiles along with maintained positional information. Such spatially resolved transcriptional characterization of intact tissue samples provides an integrated view of gene expression in its natural spatial and functional context. However, high-throughput sequencing-based ST technologies cannot yet reach single cell resolution. Thus, similar to bulk RNA-seq data, gene expression data at ST spot-level reflect transcriptional profiles of multiple cells and entail the inference of cell-type composition within each ST spot for valid and powerful subsequent analyses. Realizing the critical importance of cell-type decomposition, multiple groups have developed ST deconvolution methods. The aim of this work is to review state-of-the-art methods for ST deconvolution, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we construct ST spots from single-cell level ST data to assess the performance of 10 methods, with either ideal reference or non-ideal reference. Furthermore, we examine the performance of these methods on spot- and bead-level ST data by comparing estimated cell-type proportions to carefully matched single-cell ST data. In comparing the performance on various tissues and technological platforms, we concluded that RCTD and stereoscope achieve more robust and accurate inferences.},

As the analysis of RNA-seq data is complex, it has prompted a large amount of research on algorithms and methods. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of options available at each step of the analysis. Consequently, there is no clear consensus about the most appropriate algorithms and pipelines that should be used to analyse RNA-seq data. In the present study, 192 pipelines using alternative methods were applied to 18 samples from two human cell lines and the performance of the results was evaluated. Raw gene expression signal was quantified by non-parametric statistics to measure precision and accuracy. Differential gene expression performance was estimated by testing 17 differential expression methods. The procedures were validated by qRT-PCR in the same samples. This study weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of the tested algorithms and pipelines providing a comprehensive guide to the different methods and procedures applied to the analysis of RNA-seq data, both for the quantification of the raw expression signal and for the differential gene expression.},

To take full advantage of the added dimension on spatial location information in such data, new methods that are tailored for SRT are needed. Additionally, SRT data often have companion high-resolution histology information available. Incorporating histological features in gene expression analysis is an underexplored area.

We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advancements have enabled spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling but at multi-cellular pixel resolution, thereby hindering the identification of cell-type-specific spatial patterns and gene expression variation. To address this challenge, we develop STdeconvolve as a reference-free approach to deconvolve underlying cell types comprising such multi-cellular pixel resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) datasets. Using simulated as well as real ST datasets from diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies comprising a variety of spatial resolutions such as Spatial Transcriptomics, 10X Visium, DBiT-seq, and Slide-seq, we show that STdeconvolve can effectively recover cell-type transcriptional profiles and their proportional representation within pixels without reliance on external single-cell transcriptomics references. STdeconvolve provides comparable performance to existing reference-based methods when suitable single-cell references are available, as well as potentially superior performance when suitable single-cell references are not available. STdeconvolve is available as an open-source R software package with the source code available at https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/STdeconvolve.},

  abstract = {The function of many biological systems, such as embryos, liver lobules, intestinal villi, and tumors, depends on the spatial organization of their cells. In the past decade, high-throughput technologies have been developed to quantify gene expression in space, and computational methods have been developed that leverage spatial gene expression data to identify genes with spatial patterns and to delineate neighborhoods within tissues. To comprehensively document spatial gene expression technologies and data-analysis methods, we present a curated review of literature on spatial transcriptomics dating back to 1987, along with a thorough analysis of trends in the field, such as usage of experimental techniques, species, tissues studied, and computational approaches used. Our Review places current methods in a historical context, and we derive insights about the field that can guide current research strategies. A companion supplement offers a more detailed look at the technologies and methods analyzed: https://pachterlab.github.io/LP\_2021/.},

  abstract = {For half a century, the human brain was believed to contain about 100 billion neurons and one trillion glial cells, with a glia:neuron ratio of 10:1. A new counting method, the isotropic fractionator, has challenged the notion that glia outnumber neurons and revived a question that was widely thought to have been resolved. The recently validated isotropic fractionator demonstrates a glia:neuron ratio of less than 1:1 and a total number of less than 100 billion glial cells in the human brain. A survey of original evidence shows that histological data always supported a 1:1 ratio of glia to neurons in the entire human brain, and a range of 40–130 billion glial cells. We review how the claim of one trillion glial cells originated, was perpetuated, and eventually refuted. We compile how numbers of neurons and glial cells in the adult human brain were reported and we examine the reasons for an erroneous consensus about the relative abundance of glial cells in human brains that persisted for half a century. Our review includes a brief history of cell counting in human brains, types of counting methods that were and are employed, ranges of previous estimates, and the current status of knowledge about the number of cells. We also discuss implications and consequences of the new insights into true numbers of glial cells in the human brain, and the promise and potential impact of the newly validated isotropic fractionator for reliable quantification of glia and neurons in neurological and psychiatric diseases.},

  abstract = {Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive Schwann cell (SC)–derived soft tissue sarcoma, arises from benign neurofibroma (NF); however, the identity, heterogeneity and origins of tumor populations remain elusive. Nestin+ cells have been implicated as tumor stem cells in MPNST; unexpectedly, single-cell profiling of human NF and MPNST and their animal models reveal a broad range of nestin-expressing SC lineage cells and dynamic acquisition of discrete cancer states during malignant transformation. We uncover a nestin-negative mesenchymal neural crest-like subpopulation as a previously unknown malignant stem-like state common to murine and human MPNSTs, which correlates with clinical severity. Integrative multiomics profiling further identifies unique regulatory networks and druggable targets against the malignant subpopulations in MPNST. Targeting key epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness regulators including ZEB1 and ALDH1A1 impedes MPNST growth. Together, our studies reveal the underlying principles of tumor cell-state evolution and their regulatory circuitries during NF-to-MPNST transformation, highlighting a hitherto unrecognized mesenchymal stem-like subpopulation in MPNST disease progression.},
